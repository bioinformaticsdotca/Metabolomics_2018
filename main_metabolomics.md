# Welcome <a id="welcome"></a>

Informatics and Statistics for Metabolomics.  

## Programs to Install

1) A robust text editor.   

* For Windows/PC - [notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)  
* For Linux - [gEdit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/)  
* For Mac – [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html)

2) A file decompression tool.  

* For Windows/PC – [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/).  
* For Linux – [gzip](http://www.gzip.org).   
* For Mac – already there.

3) A robust internet browser such as Firefox or Safari (Internet Explorer and Chrome are not recommended because of Java issues).

4) [Proteowizard MS convert](http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/user_installation.shtml).  

5) Latest version of [R](http://www.r-project.org/).  

6) XCMS on R, with all relevant packages as indicated [here](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/xcms/inst/doc/xcmsInstall.pdf).  
The R folder needs to allow writing of new libraries (override the windows default read-only), or download all the packages and transfer to another folder.
check on R that the command line library(xcms) does not return an error (minor R version warning is okay).  

7) A PDF viewer (Adobe Acrobat or equivalent).  

## Do these tutorials before the workshop

1) **R Preparation tutorials**: You are expected to have completed the following tutorials in **R** beforehand. The tutorial should be very accessible even if you have never used **R** before.

* The [CBW R tutorial](http://bioinformatics-ca.github.io/CBW_R_Tutorial/)
* [Quick and Dirty Guide to **R**](http://ww2.coastal.edu/kingw/statistics/R-tutorials/text/quick&dirty_R.txt)  
* The [R Tutorial](http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/) up to and including 5. Basic Plots
* The [R command cheat sheet](https://github.com/bioinformaticsdotca/bioinformaticsdotca.github.io/blob/master/resources/R_Short-refcard.pdf)

## Before coming to the workshop, read these:
  
* [XCMS Online: a web-based platform to process untargeted metabolic data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22533540)
